<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](images/product.png)

It analyses the review of the food and services of the restaurant entered by a user for any specific restaurant and analyses what is the sentiment of the review. It helps the companies rate the movie and understand crowd sentiment regarding it. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing problem where text is understood and the underlying intent is predicted. Sentiment analysis, also called opinion mining, is the field of study that analyzes people’s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations, individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes

Here's why:
* Sentiment analysis has long been a problem for business, marketing and management areas for more
value earned in the decision process
* Sentiment Analysis also helps organisations measure the ROI of their marketing campaigns and improve their customer service.
* Since sentiment analysis gives the organisations a sneak peek into their customer’s emotions, they can be aware of any crisis that’s to come well in time – and manage it accordingly.

The dataset link is [Restaurant Review Dataset](Dataset/Restaurant_Reviews.tsv) .

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Sentiment analysis is like having a private detective listening to what your customers are saying—everywhere.

Sure, your customers might give some feedback to your customer service team directly. But they are also going to give their honest opinion on other platforms such as Facebook, discussion forums, Amazon, Twitter… the list really is endless.
Advanced sentiment analysis can not only uncover what customers are saying, but why they are saying it.
Here are the key areas for how sentiment analysis help businesses.

* Brand Monitoring
* Improving Your Customer Support
* Tracking Your Employees’ Feedback
* Providing Better Product Analytics
* Monitoring Market Research
* Keeping an Eye on Your Competition
* Tracking User Generated Content
* Uncovering Brand Influencers
* Social Media Monitoring
* Managing a Crisis Better
